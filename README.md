Basic setting for opencv using VSCode in Linux

## Introduction
For me, it is difficult to set "task.json" file properly when using VSCode. Because I had been always using "Visual Studio" which helps automatically building, when making C (or C++) programs. I don't have enough knowledge about how to compile openCV using "Cmake". Thanks to many blogs I can finally build openCV 4.0.1 in Linux(Ubuntu 16.04) with VScode. The purpose of making this repository is to set openCV quickly when starting up programs as well as to help people who have hard time to use VSCode when they make OpenCV programs. I hope that this repo could help yall. Thanks.
